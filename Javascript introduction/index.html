    1>  markup language
    A markup language is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts.Markup is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its content to facilitate automated processing. 

        programming language
    A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.
    The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language.

        scripting language
    A scripting language or script language is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system.Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled.

    2>  OOP
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.OOP was developed to make code more flexible and easier to maintain.

        POP
    pop refers to Procedural Oriented Programming and its deals with programs and functions. Programs are divided into functions and data is global.

    3>  History of JS
    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

    4>  features of JS
    some features of Javascript
        Light Weight Scripting language

        Dynamic Typing

        Object-oriented programming support

        Functional Style

        Platform Independent

        Prototype-based

        Interpreted Language

        Single-threaded

        Async Processing

        Web Workers

        Client-Side Validation

        More control in the browser
    
    5>  Interpreter
    An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in a high-level language, without converting it into machine code. In programming, we can execute a program in two ways. Firstly, through compilation and secondly, through an interpreter.

        Compiler
    A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++.

    6>  Implementation of javascript
    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes etc...
